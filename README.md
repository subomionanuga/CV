## Subomi Onanuga

Having spent the past few years in a career in Finance, I recently took the plunge and headed to Makers Academy to begin my journey towards becoming an amazing Software Developer. I am an "entertainer" personality type (probably not expected from someone with a finance background) and this is reflected in how I interact with friends and colleagues in any environment. I thrive in environments where I am always being challenged and being able to learn from others

As I embark on my Makers journey, I am excited to learn from my course coaches and cohort mates with the aim of becoming a full fledged Software Developer ready to make real-word impact.

## Skills

#### Communication

Due to the nature of my role at Notonthehighstreet, good communication was key to ensuring that stakeholders were always aware of what was required by the finance team and how we could help work towards our goals. From company wide emails informing the business of new process that I had implemented, to group and one one one training sessions about how to use the finance systems.

How has communication improved since being at Makers?

#### Reporting and Analysis

Working in a finance environment, reports and analysis are almost unavoidable. Having to work on these almost constantly meant that I was always learning better ways to gather and analyse information. I was able to streamline several of the reports that we used which increased efficiencies and "trimmed the fat" in a lot of our processes.

Attention to detail? How can this be tied in with software development and coding? Have the thinhs you've learnt at makers contributed to this?
